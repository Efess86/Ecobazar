# Ecobazar

Hey, everybody. 
I invite you to see my first big project (online food store). 
Now it is under development, but when it will be ready I will immediately report about it.
Attention. For fellow programmers. You can use any code from this repository. You can modify it and even sell it. The only thing I will ask you to do is to provide a link to this repository if possible. I should also warn you that the design does not belong to me. That is, change the styles of any of the components.
If you like the design, I got it from figma. 
Link to the design: https://www.figma.com/file/Jrl8nwJ5D0noqVTwQDHErV/Shopery---Organic-eCommerce-Shop-Website-Figma-Template-(Community)-(Community)?type=design&t=dBDWRiGupnyWrDqZ-6

Project Technologies:
Vite js.
Scss
That's all )))

How to run and view the project?
First, create a folder where a copy of the project will be stored. After you need to go to this folder 
Then clone the project with the command 
  -> git clone https://github.com/Efess86/Ecobazar.git
then 
  -> npm install
To run the project use the command 
  -> npm run dev
ip adress http://localhost:5173/ will appear in the terminal (port 5173 can be different) ctrl + click to open in a browser.
Warning. During the development stage not all components will be visible. To see the component you are interested in, you need to import it and call it. In the main.js file I left all imports and calls (they are commented out).
